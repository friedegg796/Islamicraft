SO HALAL!
Make sure to read Surah Kahf (Surah 18) on Friday!
Did you do your Salah? (If you're allowed to)
Make sure to read atleast the last 2 ayat of Surah Baqarah (Surah 2) before you sleep!
"And do not approach Zina. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way." (Surah Isra verse 32 | 17:32)
Don't forget to make dua in the last third of the night! (If you wake up)
