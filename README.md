Splash Text:
 With this resource pack, the splash text has been modified now, to represent a more Islamic outlook:

 بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ
رَبِّ أَوۡزِعۡنِيٓ أَنۡ أَشۡكُرَ نِعۡمَتَكَ ٱلَّتِيٓ أَنۡعَمۡتَ عَلَيَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَٰلِدَيَّ وَأَنۡ أَعۡمَلَ صَٰلِحٗا تَرۡضَىٰهُ وَأَصۡلِحۡ لِي فِي ذُرِّيَّتِيٓۖ إِنِّي تُبۡتُ إِلَيۡكَ وَإِنِّي مِنَ ٱلۡمُسۡلِمِينَ
Don't do haram!
Make sure to read Surah Kahf (Surah 18) on Friday!
Did you do your Salah? (If you're allowed to)
Make sure to read atleast the last 2 ayat of Surah Baqarah (Surah 2) before you sleep!
"And do not approach Zina. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way." (Surah Isra verse 32 | 17:32)
Don't forget to make dua in the last third of the night! (If you wake up)
“There are two blessings which many people waste: health and free time.” - Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 6412
Today might be your last day! Turn back to your lord!
Try kafkecraft (Texturepack)!
